User Input:
"{user_question}"

Current Date: {current_date}
Current Time: {current_time}

Response-Template:
{{
    "prompt": "the original prompt",
    "intent": "the search query your came up with",
    "links": [
        {{
            "link": "the link you found",
            "description": "a short description of the link you should come up with"
        }}
    ]
}}

Task: Extract the core search intent from the user input to use that as the query for search engines.

1. You should always respond with a JSON object in the same structure as above (Response-Template).
2. The "prompt" field should always be the same as the original prompt.
3. The "intent" field should be the search query keeping the native language of the user input.
4. The "intent" field should be a proper instruction, not just random words.
5. If it makes sense include the Current Date and Current Time in the "intent" construction, but only if it is relevant to the search query.
6. Scan the original prompt for any links, links are everything ending with a tld like .com, .org, .net, etc. or starting with http:// or https://.
8. The "links" field should contain an array of objects, each with a "link" and "description" field.
8. If you cannot find any relevant links in the prompt, you should return an empty array in the "links" field.

Absolutely make sure you uphold these instructions.
