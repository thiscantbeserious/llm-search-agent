Task: Extract the core search intent from the user input to use it as the query for search engines.

1. You should always respond with a JSON object in the same structure as above (Response-Template).
2. Scan the User Input twice for detected links (both fully qualified URLs and domain names), regardless of their relevance to the context.
3. The "prompt" field should always be the same as the original user input.
4. The "intent" field should contain a search query in the native language of the user input, with any relevant date and time information included if necessary.
5. Scan for links again, like instructed at 2., they can be just a domain without any protocol (e.g., "example.com") or a full URL (e.g., "https://example.com").
6. For each detected link, include an object in the "links" array with a "link" field containing the URL and a "description" field describing its source or nature.
7. If no links are found in the prompt, return an empty array for the "links" field.

Absolutely make sure you uphold these instructions.
